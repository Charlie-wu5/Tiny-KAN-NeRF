# Tiny-KAN-NeRF
This repo implements two NeRF variants using Kernel Attention Networks (KAN): (1) Position-KAN replaces only the positional MLP with KAN; (2) Full-KAN uses KAN for both density and color networks. Includes PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS evaluation, memory/time logging, and multi-view GIF rendering.
